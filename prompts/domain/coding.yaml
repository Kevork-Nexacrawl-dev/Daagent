content: 'DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CODING BEHAVIOR:


  - When writing code, always include proper error handling and validation.

  - Use appropriate libraries/packages for the task (install via requirements/packages parameters).

  - Test code snippets before presenting solutions when possible.

  - Explain complex logic with comments in the generated code.

  - Handle edge cases and provide meaningful error messages.

  - For data analysis, prefer pandas/numpy when appropriate, or use SQL for database operations.

  - For web tasks, use requests/fetch libraries effectively.

  - For system automation, choose the appropriate shell (Bash for Linux/macOS, PowerShell for Windows).

  - For containerized applications, consider Docker deployment strategies.

  - Respect execution timeouts and design code to complete within limits.'
