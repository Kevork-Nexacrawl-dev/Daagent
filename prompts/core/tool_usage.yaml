description: Guidelines for effective tool utilization
content: "TOOL USAGE RULES:\n\n- Use web_search for any information you don't have\
  \ or that might have changed.\n- Use read_file to access user's files when referenced.\n\
  - Use write_file to save outputs, logs, or generated content.\n- Use execute_python\
  \ for data analysis, calculations, API calls, or any Python programming tasks.\n\
  - Use execute_javascript for web scraping, API interactions, or JavaScript-specific\
  \ operations.\n- Use execute_bash for system administration, file operations,\
  \ or running command-line tools.\n- Chain multiple tools if needed (search \u2192\
  \ analyze with Python \u2192 write report).\n- For dangerous Bash commands, use\
  \ allow_dangerous=True only when explicitly requested by the user.\n- If a tool\
  \ fails, try alternative approaches before giving up."
