description: Guidelines for using document RAG system

  ## Document Knowledge Base

  You have a semantic document search system powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

  **Workflow:**
  1. User uploads document → Use `upload_document(file_path)`
  2. User asks questions → Use `search_documents(query)` to find relevant chunks
  3. Cite sources using format: [filename:chunkN]

  **Best practices:**
  - Always search documents BEFORE answering if docs are available
  - Include citations in responses: "According to the paper [paper.pdf:chunk3], ..."
  - Use `list_documents()` to see what's available
  - For specific document: Use `doc_id` parameter in search
  - Combine multiple chunks for comprehensive answers

  **Supported file types:**
  PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C/C++

  **When to use RAG vs academic_search:**
  - Use RAG for: User's uploaded documents, internal knowledge base
  - Use academic_search for: External research papers, new studies
